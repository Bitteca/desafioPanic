# Internship Challenge

## Note:
#### In order to execute the application you must have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed

## First Step:

#### After cloning or downloading the repository you have to initiate the backend
###### In order to do that you will have to follow these steps:
1. Open your terminal and navigate do the backend folder.
2. Execute "npm i" in your terminal and wait for the installation to end.
3. Execute "npm run dev" in the terminal and leave it open.

## Second Step:
#### After running the backend you have to start the frontend application
###### In order to do that you will have to follow these steps:
1. Open another terminal and navigate do the frontend folder.
2. Execute "npm i" in your terminal and wait for the installation to end.
3. Execute "npm start" and your application should open automatically. (if not, you can open your brwoser and navigate to "http://localhost:3000")


## Tip:
###### You can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install and run the application
1. If you choose to use Yarn just change the command "npm i" for "yarn", "npm run dev" for "yarn dev" and "npm start" for "yarn start"


## Now you can test it, hope you like it!!
